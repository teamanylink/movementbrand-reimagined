                Why not just hire my own in-house team or a traditional agency?

                Building an internal team or bringing on a big agency can run well into six figures annually—and that's before factoring in benefits or overhead. Plus, businesses today face fast-changing demands. Movement Brand offers a more nimble approach: a simple subscription you can pause or resume whenever you like. You only pay for what you need, exactly when you need it—no wasted resources, no rigid contracts.

                Can I put my subscription on hold?
              </AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent className="text-gray-600">
                Absolutely. Your workload may vary from month to month. If you don't have ongoing projects, simply pause your plan. Whenever you're ready to ramp back up, your unused subscription days will still be there, so you're never paying for downtime.

              <AccordionContent className="text-gray-600">
                For larger undertakings, we divide the process into logical stages. You'll receive incremental updates—usually every 24–48 hours—so you can offer feedback at each step. Overall, plan on a few weeks to complete highly involved projects like micro-SaaS, though actual timing depends on scope and complexity.

                We adapt our toolkit to your unique needs. From design software like Figma or Sketch for mockups to advanced frameworks such as React and Node.js for development, we make sure to use the best resources for the job. When it comes to automations, we can integrate existing platforms like Zapier or set up custom-coded solutions.

                While Movement Brand handles a broad range of digital projects—like landing pages, micro-SaaS, and automation setups—we don't typically take on 3D modeling, fully animated graphics (advanced GIFs, etc.), highly specialized document designs (such as medical forms), large-scale print projects (e.g., magazines or books), or InDesign-based layouts. If you're unsure whether your request falls under these categories, just reach out. We'll gladly confirm if we can accommodate you or suggest an alternative option.

              <AccordionContent className="text-gray-600">
                No worries! Our subscription model is built for flexibility. You're welcome to pause your plan once you've completed a project, then resume whenever a new need arises. That way, you're never paying for time you aren't using.

              <AccordionContent className="text-gray-600">
                We stand behind the quality of our work; as a result, we don't issue refunds once deliverables have been provided. However, our goal is always to ensure you're thrilled with the final outcome, and we're more than happy to revise and refine until it meets your expectations.
